# Sales Data Analysis
## This file is created to showcase data analytics, data visualisation and programming skills.
- In the **sales_data.xlsx file**, you would be able to find the **cleaned Excel dataset** I was working with, as well as graphs, pivot tables, and heat maps created for analysis purposes through Excel.

- In **sales_analysis.ipynb** you would find the **Python code** I wrote to analyse the data from the aforementioned Excel file, the **line chart** I made using that code, and the **interactive chart** that could be viewed via the link provided in the document (since GitHub only supports static images).

- The **findings** drawn from the data analysis and further **business suggestions** are presented at the bottom of the document.
